Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in chemical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I am currently advised by J. Christopher Love in the Koch Institute at MIT.

I am broadly interested in technology that improves our ability to understand and therapeutically manipulate the immune system, with a particular interest in strategies that can directly applied to human samples. My Ph.D. centers on the use of single-cell RNA sequencing paired with immune repertoire (TCR or BCR) sequencing to profile antigen-specific immune populations. Thus far, we have applied this technology to study tissue-resident T cell populations in patients with the allergic disease eosinophilic esophagitis, the responses of peanut-reactive CD4+ memory T cells to oral immunotherapy (a potentially curative treatment for IgE-mediated peanut allergy), antigen-specific T cell responses in mouse models of cancer, and serotype-specific B cell responses elicited by vaccination in non-human primates.

Prior to MIT, I attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, where I graduated with a B.E. in Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, and Mathematics in Spring 2017. There, I completed an honors thesis in chemical engineering in the laboratory of Professor John T. Wilson, and I was awarded the Founder's Medal for the School of Engineering. I also attended the David H. Koch School of Chemical Engineering Practice at MIT, where I attended stations at SGC Energia (Houston, TX) and Merck & Co. (Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland). I earned a M.S. in Chemical Engineering Practice in Spring 2019.
