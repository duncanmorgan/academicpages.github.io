Hello! I’m Dr. Duncan M. Morgan, a postdoctoral scientist jointly affiliated with the Berlin Center for Regenerative Therapies and the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

With a background in chemical engineering, I am passionate about leveraging data to generate actionable, translational insights that address critical biological questions. My current research focuses on modeling the spatially-resolved, dynamic cascades of cell recruitment and polarization that drive tissue regeneration across various organ systems.

I completed my Ph.D. at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, where I developed expertise in single-cell RNA sequencing paired with immune repertoire (TCR and BCR) sequencing to profile antigen-specific immune populations. My doctoral research encompassed diverse applications, including studying tissue-resident T cell populations in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, examining peanut-reactive CD4+ memory T cells in response to peanut oral immunotherapy, investigating antigen-specific T cell responses in cancer models, and characterizing serotype-specific B cell responses to vaccines in non-human primates.

Before my Ph.D., I earned an M.S. in Chemical Engineering Practice from MIT’s David H. Koch School of Chemical Engineering Practice, completing rotations at SGC Energia in Houston, TX, and Merck & Co. in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland.

I received my B.E. in Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, and Mathematics from Vanderbilt University, where I conducted my honors thesis in the lab of Professor John T. Wilson and was honored with the Founder’s Medal for the School of Engineering.

Outside the lab, I’m currently learning German, which has been an exciting way to stretch my brain and better connect with my German colleagues. To stay healthy and motivated, I train four times a week, with a goal of improving my half-marathon times one minute at a time.
