Hello! I'm a postdoctoral scientist working in a joint position between the Berlin Center for Regenerative Therapies and the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. 

I have a background in chemical engieering and a fascination with leveraging data to unlock actionable, translational insights that help to address important biological questions. In my current position, much of my attention is focused on modeling the spatially-resolved, dynamic cascades of cell recruitment and polarization that underlie tissue regeneration in a variety of organ systems.

My Ph.D., which I completed at the Koch Institute of Integrative Cancer research at MIT, centered on the use of single-cell RNA sequencing paired with immune repertoire (TCR or BCR) sequencing to profile antigen-specific immune populations. I applied this technology to study tissue-resident T cell populations in patients with the allergic disease eosinophilic esophagitis, the responses of peanut-reactive CD4+ memory T cells to peanut oral immunotherapy, antigen-specific T cell responses in mouse models of cancer, and serotype-specific B cell responses elicited by vaccination in non-human primates.

At MIT, I also attended the David H. Koch School of Chemical Engineering Practice at MIT, where I attended stations at SGC Energia (Houston, TX) and Merck & Co. (Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland). I earned a M.S. in Chemical Engineering Practice in Spring 2019.

Prior to MIT, I attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, where I graduated with a B.E. in Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, and Mathematics in Spring 2017. There, I completed an honors thesis in chemical engineering in the laboratory of Professor John T. Wilson, and I was awarded the Founder's Medal for the School of Engineering. 

These days, much of my free time is devoted to learning German, which I've found to be an interesting way to stretch my brain along a new dimension and helps me to better engage with my German colleagues. To stay healthy, happy, and motivated, I've also been training four times a week in an ever-increasing effort to reduce my half marathon times (one minute at a time).
